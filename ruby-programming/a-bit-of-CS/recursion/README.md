# RECURSION

These are my solutions to the two projects on the Recursion lesson for the Ruby Programming track.

Here is a brief description of these projects:

## Project 1: Fibonacci

 The first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1. After that, all elements are the sum of the two previous ones.
 In the project there two methods: #fibs (which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence, in a interative
 fashion) and #fibs_rec (which does the same thing as the first, but using recursion instead).

## Project 2: Merge Sort

This project implements a #merge method, which merges two sorted arrays, keeping the elements sorted in the resulting array. It 
also implements a #merge_sort method, which takes an unsorted array as input, divides it in sub-arrays down to its elements, and - then - 
joins these sub-arrays while sorting them (using recursion along the lines of the divide-and-conquer methodology).
