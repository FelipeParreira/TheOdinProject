# ADVANCED BUILDING BLOCKS

These are my solutions to the two projects on the Advanced Building Blocks lesson for the Ruby Programming track.

Here is a brief description of these projects:

## Project 1: Bubble Sort

 One way of sorting a group of items in an array is bubble sort, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they 
 are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

## Project 2: Enumerable Methods

The Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides us with lots of handy iterator 
methods. This is a rebuilding of those methods.
