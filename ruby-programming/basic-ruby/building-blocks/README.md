# BUILDING BLOCKS

These are my solutions to the three projects on the Building Blocks lesson for the Ruby Programming track.

Here is a brief description of these projects:

## Project 1: Caesar Cipher

From Wikipedia:

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, 
is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which 
each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, 
with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, 
who used it in his private correspondence.

## Project 2: Stock Picker

It is a method that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It returns a pair of days representing
the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0, and you need to buy before you can sell. 

## Project 3: Substrings

It is a method that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (a dictionary) as the second argument. 
It returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
It can handle multiple words as well.
