# OOP

These are my solutions to the two projects on the "Project: OOP" lesson for the Ruby Programming track.

Here is a brief description of these projects:

## Project 1: Tic Tac Toe

From Wikipedia:

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take 
turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal row wins the game.

## Project 2: Mastermind

Mastermind is a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with 
colored pegs), check it out on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). Each turn you get some feedback 
about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.

My implementation of Mastermind allows the user to play against the computer in both roles (as code-guesser and also as code breaker).
When the computer is the code-guesser, it can remember which guesses he got right from the last turn (both position and color, and 
only the color as well), and makes its next guess based on that.
