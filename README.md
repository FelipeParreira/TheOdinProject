# The Odin Project

The Odin Project is an online open source curriculum (available [here](https://www.theodinproject.com)), whose goal is to teach full stack web development to those with little to no coding experience.

The technologies used, besides the basic ones for the front-end (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), are the Ruby programming language and the Ruby on Rails Framework. The curriculum gathers the best free resources on the web, joining reading, tutorials and practical experience (coding real web apps) together to teach you web development.

This repository is simply a compilation of my solutions to the projects and some exercises recommended in the curriculum.
