# Blogger 2

This is the project of a simple blog, developed using the Ruby on Rails framework. Its purpose is to get familiar with the basic file structure and commands of Rails and with the deployment process with Heroku (click [here](https://warm-basin-63355.herokuapp.com/) if you want to see the deployed blog).

It was developed following the steps outlined in the [Jumpstart Labâ€™s Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) (from sections I0 to I5, but I hope to go through section I6 in the near future), using Ruby 2.5.1 and Rails 5.2.0.

If you want to see it on your browser, just run the following command on terminal (provided you are already in the project folder). And, then, go to http://0.0.0.0:3000 in your browser.

```
$ rails server
```
