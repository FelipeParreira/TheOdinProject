# Blogger 2

This is the project of a simple blog, developed using the Ruby on Rails framework. Its purpose is to get familiar with the basic file structure and commands of Rails and with the deployment process with Heroku.

It was developed following the steps outlined in the [Jumpstart Lab’s Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html), using Ruby 2.5.1 and Rails 5.2.0.

If you want to see it on your browser, just run the following command on terminal (provided you are already in the project folder). And, then, go to http://0.0.0.0:3000 in your browser.

```
$ rails server
```
